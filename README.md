# Project
Made a full stack web application for a gym client.
It has a basic landing page for gym website along with user and admin login
Admin can add/delete/edit and see the requests of people who want to join the gym
Users can register themself once gym owner added them into the gym. After registering they can login into it and can add day for workout and add there check-in and check-out time.
Users can track record of the total gym they hit in one week along with average workout hours per day and can see how much calories they have burnt.
